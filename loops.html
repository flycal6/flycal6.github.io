            <h3>Loops</h3>
            <p class="lead">
            What is the difference between a ‘for’, ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loop? Give an
            example of when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit of a ‘do
            while’ over a ‘while’?
            </p>

            <h4>While and Do While</h4>
            <p>
                <code>while</code> and <code>do while</code> loops are largely the same.  They both
                evaluate a boolean expression and if the expression evaluates to <code>true</code>,
                the loop executes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The difference is that a <code>while</code> loop evaluates the expression at the
                beginning of the loop, where the <code>do while</code> evaluates the expression at
                the end of the loop.  What this means is that the <code>do while</code> loop is
                guaranteed to execute at least once, where the <code>while</code> loop might not
                execute at all.
            </p>

            <p>
                A <code>while</code> loop is set up so that the expression is checked prior to loop
                execution, like so:
    <pre>
        while (expression) {
            // do stuff;
        }
    </pre>
                Whereas a <code>do while</code> loop is set up to evaluate the expression after the
                loop, like this:
    <pre>
        do {
            // do stuff;
        } while (expression);
    </pre>

                In both cases, be sure your expression at some point evalutates to false, or you
                will be stuck in an infinite loop.
            </p>

            <h4>For Loops</h4>
            <p>
                <code>for</code> loops are a better choice when you want to execute a statement a
                specific number or times, or you want to iterate through an array.
            </p>

            <p>
                A basic <code>for</code> loop has three requirements to get going: <code>
                initialization; termination; increment</code>, and looks like this:
    <pre>
        for (initialization; termination; increment) {
            // do stuff;
        }
    </pre>

                The <code>initialization</code> expression is executed only once, as the loop begins.
                The <code>termination</code> expression is evaluated at the start of each loop to
                check if the loop should terminate, and the loop executes as long as it evaluates to
                true.  The <code>increment</code> expression is invoked at the end of each loop, and
                increments the variable which was initialized.  This can increase or decrease.
            </p>

            <p>
                The following will loop 10 times:
                <pre>
                for(int i=1; i<11; i++){
                    System.out.println("Count is: " + i);
                }
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Java also has an <i>Enhanced For Loop</i>, which is specifically for iterating over
                arrays or similar.  The syntax is slightly more compact and easy to read.
            </p>

            <p>
                Enhanced For Loop:
                <pre>
                int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};

                for (int item : numbers) {
                    System.out.println("number " + item);
                }
                </pre>
                The above example will loop once for each <code>item</code> found in the array <code>
                numbers[]</code>.
