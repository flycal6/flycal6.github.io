            <h3>Switch vs If/Else Statements</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one
                versus the other?
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have a lot of <code>else if</code> statements chained together, checking the
                same variable, it will probably be quicker and easier to write a <code>switch case
                </code> instead.
            </p>

            <p>
                Compare the following examples:
                <br  />
                <h5>If/Else</h5>

                <pre>
                int age = 5;<br  />
                if (age == 5) {
                    System.out.println("you attend school");
                } else if (age == 4) {
                    System.out.println("you attend preschool");
                } else if (age == 3) {
                    System.out.println("you attend daycare");
                } else if (age == 2) {
                    System.out.println("you can crawl");
                } else if (age == 1) {
                    System.out.println("you can babble");
                } else {
                    System.out.println("I don't know what you can do")
                }
                </pre>

                <h5>Switch</h5>

                <pre>
                int age = 5;

                switch (age) {
                    case 5:
                        System.out.println("you attend school");
                        break;
                    case 4:
                        System.out.println("you attend preschool");
                        break;
                    case 3:
                        System.out.println("you attend daycare");
                        break;
                    case 2:
                        System.out.println("you can crawl");
                        break;
                    case 1:
                        System.out.println("you can babble");
                        break;
                    default:
                        System.out.println("I don't know what you can do");
                        break;
                }
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                A <code>switch</code> behaves much like an <code>if/else</code> chain.  The program
                will fall through the cases, and catch when it finds a matching condition.  Our
                keyword <code> break</code> stops the <code>switch</code> from continuing to check
                cases.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both examples achieve the same result, but the switch statement is more plainly
                obvious that you are only checking a single variable.  This can help out when
                someone else has to go back and read your code.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code>switch</code> is also slightly faster to execute, which probably doesn't
                matter, but maybe it will if you are working on something really large.
