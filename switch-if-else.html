            <h3>Switch vs If/Else Statements</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one
                versus the other?
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have a lot of <code>else if</code> statements chained together, checking the
                same variable, it will probably be quicker and easier to write a <code>switch case
                </code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Compare the following examples which produce the same output: <i>you attend daycare
                </i>. The switch statement is more obvious that you are only checking a single variable.
                This can help out when someone else has to go back and read your code.

                <h5>If/Else</h5>

    <!--<pre> indenting here will match what shows up in the browser, so be careful  -->
    <pre>
    int age = 3;<br  />
    if (age == 1) {
        System.out.println("you can babble");
    } else if (age == 2) {
        System.out.println("you can crawl");
    } else if (age == 3) {
        System.out.println("you attend daycare");
    } else if (age == 4) {
        System.out.println("you attend preschool");
    } else if (age == 5) {
        System.out.println("you attend school");
    } else {
        System.out.println("I don't know what you can do")
    }
    </pre>

                <h5>Switch</h5>

    <!--<pre> indenting here will match what shows up in the browser, so be careful  -->
    <pre>
    int age = 3;

    switch (age) {
        case 1:
            System.out.println("you can babble");
            break;
        case 2:
            System.out.println("you can crawl");
            break;
        case 3:
            System.out.println("you attend daycare");
            break;
        case 4:
            System.out.println("you attend preschool");
            break;
        case 5:
            System.out.println("you attend school");
            break;
        default:
            System.out.println("I don't know what you can do");
            break;
    }
    </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                A <code>switch</code> behaves much like an <code>if/else</code> chain.  The program
                will fall through the cases, and catch when it finds a matching condition.  Our
                keyword <code> break</code> stops the <code>switch</code> from continuing to check
                cases.
            </p>


            <p>
                <i>Fall Through</i> happens if there is no <code>break</code> statement, and all
                cases after finding a match will be executed in sequence, like so:

    <!--<pre> indenting here will match what shows up in the browser, so be careful  -->
    <pre>
    int age = 3;

    switch (age) {
        case 1:
            System.out.println("you can babble");
        case 2:
            System.out.println("you can crawl");
        case 3:
            System.out.println("you attend daycare");
        case 4:
            System.out.println("you attend preschool");
        case 5:
            System.out.println("you attend school");
            break;
        default:
            System.out.println("I don't know what you can do");
            break;
    }
    </pre>
                will output: <br /><i>you attend daycare<br  />you attend preschool<br  />you attend
                     school</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also apply multiple <code>case</code> labels to a single statement, as seen
                below:

    <pre>
        int day = 7;
        String dayString;

        switch (day) {
            case 1: case 7:
                dayString = "weekend";
                break;
            case 2: case 3: case 4: case 5: case 6:
                dayString = "weekday";
                break;
            default:
                dayString = "invalid day";
                break;
        }
        System.out.println("That day is a " + dayString);
    </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, a <code>switch</code> is also slightly faster to execute, which probably doesn't
                matter, but maybe if you are working on something really, really large.
